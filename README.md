# Climate-specialised-LLM-improvement
We improved a climate-specialised LLM model using LangChain. This project was part of the DSBAM12023 student Hackathon, in collaboration with Ekimetrics.

Ekimetrics has developed an open-source application, ClimateQA (https://climateqa.com/), which helps the public and scientists get accurate answers to their climate change questions. The app is based on authoritative sources like the IPCC and IPBES reports. During this one-day Hackathon, participant groups were tasked with building a new feature for the app.

Using LangChain, our team focused on enhancing the customization of the answer text. We successfully built features that enable length customization, language translation, and tone variation, making the app more user-centric and accessible to a wider audience.

These new features significantly improve the user experience by allowing responses to be tailored to specific needs, whether itâ€™s providing concise information for quick understanding or detailed explanations for in-depth research. The language translation capability makes the insights from ClimateQA accessible to non-English speakers, thus broadening its reach to a global audience. The tone variation adds flexibility, enabling users to switch between formal, casual, or even more enthusiastic tones, making it suitable for diverse contexts, from academic research to educational outreach. This customization greatly enhances the app's usability and engagement, making ClimateQA a more versatile tool in the fight against climate change.
